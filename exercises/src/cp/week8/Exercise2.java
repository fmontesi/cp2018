	- Create a static class for cacheing the names of some cities in a static field.
	- Initialise the static field with some cities, e.g., Copenhagen and Odense.
	- Start two threads that each adds some (different) cities.
	- The two threads will share the static field, potentially having problems.
	- Make the static field for city names a ThreadLocal to make it local to threads.
