	 * This method recursively visits a directory to find all the text

	 * You must consider only files ending with a ".txt" suffix.
	 * You are guaranteed that they will be text files.
	 * 
	 * You can assume that each text file contains a (non-empty)
	 * comma-separated sequence of
	 * numbers. For example: 100,200,34,25
	 * There won't be any new lines, spaces, etc., and the sequence never
	 * ends with a comma.
	 * You are guaranteed that each number will be at least or equal to
	 * 0 (zero), i.e., no negative numbers.
	 * 
	 * The search is recursive: if the directory contains subdirectories,
	 * these are also searched and so on so forth (until there are no more
	 * subdirectories).
	 * 
	 * This method returns a list of results.
	 * The list contains a result for each text file that you find.
	 * Each {@link Result} stores the path of its text file,
	 * and the average of all numbers found inside of the text file.
	 * 
	 * @param dir the directory to search
	 * @return a list of results ({@link Result}), each giving the average number found in a file

	 * (without waiting to analyse also the other files).
	 * The return value is a result that contains:
	 *	- path: the path to the text file that contains the line that respects the condition;
